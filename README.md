 About Me  


I am an MSc Physics student with a deep passion for understanding the fundamental laws that govern the universe. My primary areas of interest include Astrophysics, Cosmology,Quantum mechanics, and Laser–Plasma Physics, where I explore phenomena ranging from high-energy plasma interactions to the large-scale structure and evolution of the cosmos.

I am particularly fascinated by how extreme physical conditions — such as those found in stellar environments, high-energy astrophysical systems, and laser-induced plasma dynamics  can be modeled and studied using computational techniques. My academic curiosity drives me to bridge the gap between theoretical physics and practical implementation.

My approach to physics is strongly computational. I translate mathematical models and physical equations into simulations and analytical tools using Python and scientific computing libraries. I enjoy working on:

- Numerical simulations and computational modeling  
- Data analysis and visualization for scientific datasets  
- Algorithmic problem solving  
- Physics-based software tools  

Beyond pure computational work, I actively engage in hardware-oriented projects. I design and develop Arduino-based robotics systems, integrate motor drivers and embedded components, and apply control logic to build functional real-world systems. This hands-on engineering experience strengthens my understanding of applied physics and system dynamics.

In addition, I am developing foundational knowledge in ethical hacking and cybersecurity. I am interested in understanding secure systems, network fundamentals, and the importance of protecting computational infrastructure in scientific and technological environments.

I aim to work at the intersection of Computational Physics, High-Energy Astrophysics, Plasma Dynamics, and Intelligent Technological Systems. My long-term goal is to contribute to advanced research and innovation where scientific theory, data science, secure computing, and engineering solutions converge.
